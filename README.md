# Daily DSA Practice

This is my public log of practicing data structures and algorithms in java. I'm solving problems every day and pushing whatever I work on here.

## Why I'm doing this

I need to get better at DSA for interviews and just general problem-solving. Instead of practicing in private, I figured why not share it. Some days will be good, some days I'll struggle - that's just how learning works.

## What's in here

Whatever problem I'm working on that day. Sometimes it's basic stuff, sometimes it's harder. I don't have everything organized perfectly yet, and honestly the organization will probably change as I go.

## How I'm approaching this

I'm trying to actually understand what I'm doing instead of just memorizing solutions. If I don't get something, I'll come back to it. Sometimes I'll solve the same problem different ways just to see what works better.

If you're learning DSA too, feel free to look around or hit me up to talk about different ways to solve things.
